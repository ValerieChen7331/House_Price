# House_Price
The purpose of this side project is to analyze house prices in Taiwan over the past decade, focusing on residential properties.

All of the data comes from the government system 'Actual Price Registration'.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The project is broken down into two steps: data cleaning and data analysis.

Step 1. Data Cleaning:
-In the 1~4 main programs, the data is initially cleaned and then filtered to select all the necessary data.Next, we will sequentially introduce the functions and processes of each main program:

  1-1. Examine the raw data and organizing it into structured tables.
  1-2. Translate the column headers into English for clearer comprehension and uniformity.
  1-3. Analyze the distribution of 'null values' in the raw data, identifying gaps and inconsistencies.
  1-4. Analyze the relationships between all fields to uncover patterns and correlations.
